/**
 * Experimental TypeScript definitions to capture types of the key artifacts
 * from `loopback-datasource-juggler` module. One of the main purposes is to
 * leverage such types in `LoopBack 4`'s bridge to juggler.
 *
 * Please note some of the classes, properties, methods, and functions are
 * intentionally not included in the definitions because of one of the following
 * factors:
 *
 * - They are internal
 * - They are to be deprecated
