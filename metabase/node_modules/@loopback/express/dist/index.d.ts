/**
 * The Express integration package for loopback-next.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * This module introduces Koa style cascading middleware that leverage
 * `async/await`. It also enables the ability to plug in existing Express
 * middleware as LoopBack middleware or interceptors so that they can be used at
 * sequence/action, global interceptor, and local interceptor tiers.
 *
 * This module also serves as a standalone extension to Express to provide
 * extensibility and composability for large-scale Express applications by
 * leveraging LoopBack's Dependency Injection and Extension Point/Extension
 * pattern.
